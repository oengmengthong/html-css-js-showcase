# Web Native Showcase

This repository is a playground for showcasing web capabilities using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal is to collect small, self‑contained examples that demonstrate native browser features without relying on external frameworks.

## Showcases

- [Responsive layout with header, footer, and side navigation](responsive-layout/)
- [Interactive image gallery with lightbox effect](image-gallery/)

## Planned Showcases

The following ideas are candidates for future demonstrations:
- Form validation using HTML5 attributes and JavaScript enhancements.
- CSS animations and transitions triggered by user interaction.
- Fetch API example retrieving and displaying remote data.
- Simple drag‑and‑drop interface.

## Contributing

Ideas for additional showcases are welcome! Open an issue or submit a pull request with a new example, and update this list to keep track of progress.
